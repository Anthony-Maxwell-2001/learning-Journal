# Week 1

## Learning activities and resources: 
Truthfully a lot of the time working on this was spent understanding how the class was layed out and how to find all the relevant information, so the vast majority was spent on github. Bootstrap exmaples & the documentation was also used in the creation of the website.

## Estimated hours: 

7

## Content Insights:

I spent some time re-familiazring myself with HTML and CSS as well as my IDE of choice going forwards in this subject, VS Code. However it didn't take long for it all to "click" with me again so I ultimately didn't spend much time on that.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights:

I started this work late due to a number of issues that happened in my personal life and as a result I was left quite stressed when I started this. This stress lead to me not really stopping to think or glossing over work and as a result spending a lot time wasted. For example, at first I thought for the learning journal I would have to make a blog type website for it until I read the github resources page and found it was to be done in markdown instead. I think the biggest insight I can glean from this is that when I'm running behind I shouldn't rush, and instead take that extra time to just slow down and read exactly what needs to be done, lest I cause more problems for myself.
